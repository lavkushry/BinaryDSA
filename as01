1. **What is a Computer?**
   A computer is an electronic device that processes data to perform various tasks. It can receive, store, process, and output information. Computers can be programmed to execute a wide range of functions and are used for tasks such as calculations, data storage, communication, and more.

2. **What is RAM?**
   RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that is used to store data and machine code currently being used and processed by a computer. Unlike storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, RAM is volatile memory, meaning it loses its contents when the power is turned off. It provides quick access to data and allows the CPU to read and write data rapidly.

3. **Where is data stored in a computer?**
   Data in a computer is stored in various types of storage devices, such as hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), optical drives, and USB flash drives. These storage devices retain data even when the computer is powered off, unlike RAM.

4. **What is that input device used to type text and numbers on a document in the computer system?**
   The input device used to type text and numbers on a document in a computer system is a **keyboard**.

5. **What are the output devices?**
   Output devices in a computer system include devices that present information to the user. Common output devices include monitors (display screens), printers, speakers, and headphones.

6. **Which is the input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen?**
   The input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen is a **mouse**.

7. **Which language is directly understood by the computer without a translation program?**
   The language directly understood by the computer without a translation program is **machine code** or **binary code**. Machine code consists of instructions written in binary, which is a series of 0s and 1s that the computer's central processing unit (CPU) can directly execute.

8. **What are Input devices?**
   Input devices are devices that allow users to input data or commands into a computer system. Examples of input devices include keyboards, mice, touchpads, scanners, and microphones. These devices enable users to interact with and provide input to the computer.
